    <h1> EdTech Websites and Apps</hi>
    <h4>There are many great EdTech websites and apps that can help aid in teaching! Below are some of my favorite ones.</h4> 
    <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> <a href="https://nearpod.com/" target="blank">Nearpod</strong></a></li>
          <ul>  
          <li> <a role="button" id="readmore"> Read More > </a>
            <div class = "hidden"> <a role="button" id="readless"> Read Less ^ </a> Nearpod is a great tool to have in the classroom. Teachers can create lessons to engage student in within the classroom and in an online setting. Students can look at slides, watch videos, and take part in challenges during a Nearpod lesson. Also, another great tool is being able to share the lessons between teachers. This allows for better collaboration between teachers!
