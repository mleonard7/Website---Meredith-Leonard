  My name is Meredith Leonard, and this is my last semester in my M.Ed graduate degree in Learning Design and Technology. I started my graduate degree in Summer 1 of 2021. I started immediately after graduating with my undergraduate in Elementary Education with Concentrations in Behavioral Studies and Language Arts. I am enjoying all that I am learning in my program. I look forward to applying it in my graduate program to my classroom and future endeavors. Below are some facts about me.
